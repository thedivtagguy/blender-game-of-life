# Procedural Structures in Blender
## 3D Conway's Game of Life

This addon allows you to create procedural 3D [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) structures in Blender.

### Development Roadmap
## 3D GoL in Blender, Creating Procedural Structures

- [x] ~~Create a 10x10 grid and select random 1x1 units and spawn cubes there.~~
- [ ] Figuring out how to read and interpret user defined bounds and generate N number of cubes within that area. 
- [ ] Figure out how to read locations of cubes and generate new cubes based on some relative distance to them.
- [x] ~~Make these generations of cubes not overlap and snap to each other, vertically or horizontally. Randomize direction.~~
- [ ] Make the above customizable by asking the user the number of generations they'd like.
- [ ] Construct a UI panel for the above by allowing the user to select the object they want to replicate and the number of generations they'd like. 
- [ ] Generate cubes based on Game of Life rules, not random directions. 
- [ ] Allow customization of size of cubes and number of iterations. 
- [ ] Allow keyframing each iteration.
